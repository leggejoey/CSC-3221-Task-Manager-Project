# CSC-3221-Task-Manager-Project
- basically simple list with another list that the user doesn't really touch directly and that stores tasks that are unfinished or finished (maybe displays them)
- create a way to do like a markdown strike through a list item,
- redo some of the UI elements like the trash and the check mark to make them make more sense for the lab,
- (I think) add a completed items list to show what has been finished,
- maybe something else idk my brain go brrr
